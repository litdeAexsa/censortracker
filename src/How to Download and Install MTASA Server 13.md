Before running the server, you need to configure some settings in the file "mtaserver.conf", which is located in the "mods/deathmatch" folder. This file contains various options such as server name, password, port, max players, resources to load, etc. You can edit this file with any text editor such as Notepad or Nano.
 
After configuring the server settings, you can run the server and check if it is working properly. You can use the server console or the ingame console to enter commands and view messages. You can also connect to your server using MTA:SA Client, which is a separate program that you need to download and install from the official website[^1^].
